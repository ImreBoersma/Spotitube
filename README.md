# Spotitube
Spotify and Youtube have joined forces and are working together on an app (Spotitube) that gives a customer an overview of playlists containing audio and video streams.

Assignment can be found [here](https://github.com/ImreBoersma/spotitube/blob/main/assignment.md).

API Spec can be found [here](https://github.com/HANICA-DEA/spotitube/blob/master/README.md).

To test this project it is currently still necessary to execute the file `/src/test/java/nl/imreboersma/utils/script.sql`. And after the test delete the database.
We are working on making this happen automatically.

The delivery document can be found in `/docs/`

Also, a SQL Server driver is needed in the `/lib/` folder in the tomEE files. This one is [here]([https://download.microsoft.com/download/b/c/5/bc5e407f-97ff-42ea-959d-12f2391063d7/sqljdbc_9.4.0.0_enu.zip](https://download. microsoft.com/download/b/c/5/bc5e407f-97ff-42ea-959d-12f2391063d7/sqljdbc_9.4.0.0_enu.zip)).
